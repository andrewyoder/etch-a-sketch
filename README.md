Grid cells change color when the mouse passes over them

Requirements from The Odin Project's "Etch-A-Sketch":
  - initially 16x16 grid of cells
  - "reset" button at the top, prompt allows input for new
    grid size with a max of 100x100
  - hovering over a cell changes the color of that cell 

This project is for practice using event handlers to manipulate 
DOM elements.

TO-DO:
  - make all cells the same height as they are width (look into CSS grids)
  - add a "rainbow" button that sets each new cell to a random color
  - add a "trace" button that will darken each cell by 10% each time
    it is passed over
