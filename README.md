Grid cells change color when the mouse passes over them

Requirements from The Odin Project's "Etch-A-Sketch":
  - initially 16x16 grid of cells
  - "reset" button at the top, prompt allows input for new
    grid size with a max of 100x100
  - hovering over a cell changes the color of that cell 

This project is for practice using event handlers to manipulate 
DOM elements.
